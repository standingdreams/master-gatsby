## FAQ

**Q:** How can I set a custom Emmet expand keyboard shortcut?

**A:** In VS Code, you can go to `File` -> `Preferences` -> `Keyboard Shortcuts` (Windows, Linux) or `Code` -> `Preferences` -> `Keyboard Shortcuts` (Mac). Search for `Emmet Expand Abbreviation` and you should see the current keyboard shortcut there. Double-click on the current key-bind to set a new keyboard shortcut. I have mine set to `Ctrl` + `E` which I really like but you can pick any combo you like! 

**Q:** What is the the trick used that helps with reloading the page?

**A:** It's the Fast Refresh Environment Variable. You add `GATSBY_HOT_LOADER=fast-refresh` inside of your `.env` file. There is an example `.env` file in the `finished-files` directory. It is usable in gatsby@2.19.39 onward.
